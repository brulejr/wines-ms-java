# Getting Started

### Setup Local MongoDB
This application requires a local version of MongoDB running on the standard port. This can be
achieved using Docker.

Create the following `docker-compose.yml` file in any appropriate directory:
```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  mongodb_container:
    image: mongo:latest
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data_container:/data/db

volumes:
  mongodb_data_container:
```
From that directory, start the MongoDB process with the following command:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
